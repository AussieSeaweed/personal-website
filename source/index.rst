My name is Juho.
I'm an incoming PhD student in the `Computer Science Department <https://csd.cmu.edu/>`_ at Carnegie Mellon University.
I obtained a BASc in Engineering Science at the University of Toronto.
My `CV <https://github.com/AussieSeaweed/personal-cv/releases/latest/download/main.pdf>`_, `GitHub <https://github.com/AussieSeaweed>`_, `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHbLHD0AAAAJ>`_, `website (this site) <https://juhokim.net/>`_, `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/aussieseaweed/>`_, and `email <mailto:juho-kim@outlook.com>`_ can be accessed from `my landing page <https://aussieseaweed.com>`_.

My main research topics include computational game theory and computer games (mostly poker).
I'm also interested in computational social studies (e.g., musicology), automated theorem proving, (parts of) software engineering, and symbolic computation.

I like to play video games, play or listen to classical music, and watch anime. Fluent in English and Korean, I'm currently learning French, Japanese, and Hanja.

Please feel free to reach out to me `via email <mailto:juho-kim@outlook.com>`_.
