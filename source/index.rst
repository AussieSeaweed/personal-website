My name is Juho Kim, and I'm a first-year PhD student in the `Computer Science Department <https://csd.cmu.edu/>`_ at Carnegie Mellon University.
I'm fortunate to be advised by `Professor Tuomas Sandholm <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/>`_.
I obtained a BASc in Engineering Science at the University of Toronto where I completed my thesis with `Professor Michael Guerzhoy <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/>`_ and capstone project with `Professor Michael Stumm <https://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~stumm/>`_.

My main research topics include computational game theory, computer games, and computational humanities and social sciences.
I'm also interested in computational complexity, automated theorem proving, software engineering, and symbolic computation.

You can see my `CV <https://github.com/AussieSeaweed/personal-cv/releases/latest/download/main.pdf>`_, and profiles on `GitHub <https://github.com/AussieSeaweed>`_, `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHbLHD0AAAAJ>`_, and `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/aussieseaweed/>`_.
